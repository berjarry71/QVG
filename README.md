## What this repository contains

This repository provides the complete numerical implementation of the
**QVG self-consistent equation** — the central original contribution of the
QVG program beyond the Connes-Chamseddine NCG framework.

### Scientific context

The QVG program extends the noncommutative geometry (NCG) of
Connes-Chamseddine by adding:

1. **A self-consistent spectral equation** (Chapter 5 of the book) that
   selects the Standard Model as the unique fixed point of a spectral
   free-energy functional F_ρ[T].

2. **A spectral Planck law of the vacuum** (Chapter 14) that resolves
   the cosmological constant problem by analogy with Planck 1900.

The foundational NCG results (algebra A_F, gauge group, sin²θ_W = 3/8,
m_H ≈ 125 GeV) are due to Connes and Chamseddine (1997–2012) and are
used here as prerequisites.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/berjarry71/QVG.git
cd QVG
pip install -r requirements.txt
python core/spectral_triplet.py
```

Expected output:
```
N = 96 fermionic modes  ✓
Tr(Y²)/Tr(T₃²) = 1.666667  [5/3 = 1.666667]  ✓
sin²θ_W(uniform ρ) = 0.375000  [Connes: 3/8 = 0.375000]  ✓
```

## Status and limitations

| Result | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Uniqueness of fixed point | ✓ Numerically established (8 starts) |
| Uniqueness — analytical proof | ✗ In progress (Open Frontier F2) |
| Fermion masses | ✓ Agreement 1–4% |
| CKM mixing angles | ✓ Agreement < 3% |
| PMNS angles | ✓ Agreement < 4% |
| Baryon asymmetry η_B | ✓ Agreement < 5% |
| Higgs VEV v = 247.3 GeV | ✓ Agreement 0.44% |
| Λ_cosmo (14% residual) | ✓ Partial — K_ij coupling pending |
| Strong CP θ_QCD | ✓ Z₂ symmetry argument — 4-loop not yet verified |

**External inputs:** Λ_GUT ≈ 2×10¹⁶ GeV and spectral cutoff function f.
The claim "zero free parameters" applies specifically to the 19 Standard
Model parameters. Λ_GUT and f are the two external inputs of the program.

## Falsifiable predictions

| Prediction | Value | Experiment | Horizon |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| γ (CKM angle) | 65.4° | Belle II | 2026–28 |
| δ_PMNS | 1.32 rad | DUNE/HK | 2027–30 |
| \|m_ββ\| | 7.41 meV | nEXO | 2029–32 |
| Spectral Casimir | regime change at d* ≈ 62 μm
| Grav. decoherence | 10⁻²² s⁻¹ | MAQRO | 2030–35 |

**Note on the Casimir prediction:** The QVG introduces a characteristic
length scale d* = ℏc/E₀ ≈ 62 μm. For d < d*, the QVG correction to
the Casimir pressure exceeds the standard QFT value. This is a change
of physical regime, not a small perturbative correction.
